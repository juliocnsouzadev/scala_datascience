# Scala Programming & Data Science

To light a fire, do you use a match, a lighter, or a torch? Depends on the size of the fire, much like the decisions that lead one to use Python, R, or Scala. Spark your interest in selecting the tools you need to tackle Big Data with ease, that will not just blow out.

Data Scientists tend to favor one of three programming languages, Python, R, or Scala. Scala, short fore scalable language, is the future ready. Move beyond your regular java, and check out what is brewing in this language.

# Program on a Higher Level
## Discover how to write elegant code that works the first time it is run.
This Specialization provides a hands-on introduction to functional programming using the widespread programming language, Scala. It begins from the basic building blocks of the functional paradigm, first showing how to use these blocks to solve small problems, before building up to combining these concepts to architect larger functional programs. You'll see how the functional paradigm facilitates parallel and distributed programming, and through a series of hands on examples and programming assignments, you'll learn how to analyze data sets small to large; from parallel programming on multicore architectures, to distributed programming on a cluster using Apache Spark. A final capstone project will allow you to apply the skills you learned by building a large data-intensive application using real-world data.
