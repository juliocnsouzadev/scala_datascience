[Gen,1,9,And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.~]
[Gen,1,10,And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.~]
[Gen,1,11,And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.~]
[Gen,1,12,And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.~]
[Gen,1,14,And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:~]
[Gen,1,16,And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.~]
[Gen,1,17,And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,~]
[Gen,1,18,And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.~]

[Gen,1,22,And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.~]
[Gen,1,24,And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.~]
[Gen,1,25,And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.~]
[Gen,1,26,And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.~]

[Gen,2,2,And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.~]
[Gen,2,3,And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.~]
[Gen,2,4,These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,~]
[Gen,2,5,And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.~]
[Gen,2,7,And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.~]
[Gen,2,8,And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.~]
[Gen,2,9,And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.~]
[Gen,2,15,And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.~]
[Gen,2,16,And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:~]
[Gen,2,18,And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.~]
[Gen,2,19,And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.~]
[Gen,2,21,And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;~]
[Gen,2,22,And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.~]
[Gen,3,1,Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?~]
[Gen,3,3,But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.~]
[Gen,3,5,For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.~]
[Gen,3,8,And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.~]
[Gen,3,9,And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?~]
[Gen,3,13,And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.~]
[Gen,3,14,And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:~]
[Gen,3,21,Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.~]
[Gen,3,22,And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:~]

[Gen,5,22,And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:~]
[Gen,5,24,And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.~]
[Gen,6,2,That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.~]

[Num,22,22,And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.~]
[Num,22,38,And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.~]
[Num,23,4,And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.~]
[Num,23,8,How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the LORD hath not defied?~]
[Num,23,19,God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?~]
[Num,23,21,He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them.~]
[Num,23,22,God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.~]
[Num,23,23,Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!~]
[Num,23,27,And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.~]
[Num,24,2,And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.~]
[Num,24,4,He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:~]
[Num,24,8,God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.~]
[Num,24,16,He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:~]
[Num,24,23,And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!~]
[Num,25,13,And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.~]
[Num,27,16,Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,~]
[Deu,1,6,The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:~]
[Deu,1,10,The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.~]
[Deu,1,11,(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)~]
[Deu,1,17,Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.~]
[Deu,1,19,And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.~]
[Deu,1,20,And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.~]
[Deu,1,21,Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.~]
[Deu,1,25,And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.~]
[Deu,1,26,Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:~]
[Deu,1,30,The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;~]
[Deu,1,31,And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.~]
[Deu,1,32,Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,~]
[Deu,1,41,Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.~]
[Deu,2,7,For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.~]
[Deu,2,29,(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.~]
[Deu,2,30,But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.~]
[Deu,2,33,And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.~]
[Deu,2,36,From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:~]
[Deu,2,37,Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.~]
[Deu,3,3,So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.~]
[Deu,3,18,And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.~]
[Deu,3,20,Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.~]
[Deu,3,21,And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.~]
[Deu,3,22,Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.~]
[Deu,3,24,O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?~]
[Deu,4,1,Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.~]
[Deu,4,2,Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.~]
[Deu,4,3,Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.~]
[Deu,4,4,But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day.~]
[Deu,4,5,Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.~]
[Deu,4,7,For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?~]
[Deu,4,10,Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.~]
[Deu,4,19,And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.~]
[Deu,4,21,Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:~]
[Deu,4,23,Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.~]
[Deu,4,24,For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.~]
[Deu,4,25,When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:~]
[Deu,4,29,But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.~]
[Deu,4,30,When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;~]
[Deu,4,31,(For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.~]
[Deu,4,32,For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?~]
[Deu,4,33,Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?~]
[Deu,4,34,Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?~]
[Deu,4,35,Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him.~]
[Deu,4,39,Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.~]
[Deu,4,40,Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.~]
[Deu,5,2,The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.~]
[Deu,5,6,I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.~]
[Deu,5,9,Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,~]
[Deu,5,11,Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.~]
[Deu,5,12,Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee.~]
[Deu,5,14,But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.~]
[Deu,5,15,And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.~]
[Deu,5,16,Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.~]
[Deu,5,24,And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.~]
[Deu,5,25,Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.~]
[Deu,5,26,For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?~]
[Deu,5,27,Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.~]
[Deu,5,32,Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.~]
[Deu,5,33,Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.~]
[Deu,6,1,Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it:~]
[Deu,6,2,That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.~]
[Deu,6,3,Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.~]
[Deu,6,4,Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:~]
[Deu,6,5,And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.~]
[Deu,6,10,And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not,~]
[Deu,6,13,Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name.~]
[Deu,6,15,(For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.~]
[Deu,6,16,Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in Massah.~]
[Deu,6,17,Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.~]
[Deu,6,20,And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you?~]
[Deu,6,24,And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.~]
[Deu,6,25,And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.~]
[Deu,7,1,When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;~]
[Deu,7,2,And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:~]
[Deu,7,6,For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.~]
[Deu,7,9,Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;~]
[Deu,7,12,Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:~]
[Deu,7,16,And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.~]
[Deu,7,18,Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;~]
[Deu,7,19,The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.~]
[Deu,7,20,Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.~]
[Deu,7,21,Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible.~]
[Deu,7,22,And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.~]
[Deu,7,23,But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.~]
[Deu,7,25,The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God.~]
[Deu,8,2,And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.~]
[Deu,8,5,Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.~]
[Deu,8,6,Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.~]
[Deu,8,7,For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;~]
[Deu,8,10,When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.~]
[Deu,8,11,Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:~]
[Deu,8,14,Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;~]
[Deu,8,18,But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.~]
[Deu,8,19,And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.~]
[Deu,8,20,As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your God.~]
[Deu,9,3,Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.~]
[Deu,9,4,Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.~]
[Deu,9,5,Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.~]
[Deu,9,6,Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.~]
[Deu,9,7,Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.~]
[Deu,9,10,And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.~]
[Deu,9,16,And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.~]
[Deu,9,23,Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.~]
[Deu,10,9,Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him.~]
[Deu,10,12,And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,~]
[Deu,10,14,Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's thy God, the earth also, with all that therein is.~]
[Deu,10,17,For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward:~]
[Deu,10,20,Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.~]
[Deu,10,21,He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.~]
[Deu,10,22,Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.~]
[Deu,11,1,Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.~]
[Deu,11,2,And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,~]
[Deu,11,12,A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.~]
[Deu,11,13,And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,~]
[Deu,11,22,For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;~]
[Deu,11,25,There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.~]
[Deu,11,27,A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day:~]
[Deu,11,28,And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.~]
[Deu,11,29,And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.~]
[Deu,11,31,For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.~]
[Deu,12,1,These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.~]
[Deu,12,4,Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.~]
[Deu,12,5,But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:~]
[Deu,12,7,And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.~]
[Deu,12,9,For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God giveth you.~]
[Deu,12,10,But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;~]
[Deu,12,11,Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD:~]
[Deu,12,12,And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.~]
[Deu,12,15,Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.~]
[Deu,12,18,But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto.~]
[Deu,12,20,When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.~]
[Deu,12,21,If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.~]
[Deu,12,27,And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.~]
[Deu,12,28,Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God.~]
[Deu,12,29,When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land;~]
[Deu,12,31,Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.~]
[Deu,13,3,Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.~]
[Deu,13,4,Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.~]
[Deu,13,5,And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.~]

[Deu,33,27,The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.~]
[Jos,1,9,Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.~]
[Jos,1,11,Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.~]
[Jos,1,13,Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.~]
[Jos,1,15,Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.~]
[Jos,1,17,According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.~]
[Jos,2,11,And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.~]
[Jos,3,3,And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.~]
[Jos,3,9,And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.~]
[Jos,3,10,And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.~]
[Jos,4,5,And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:~]
[Jos,4,23,For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:~]
[Jos,4,24,That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.~]
[Jos,7,7,And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!~]
[Jos,7,13,Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.~]
[Jos,7,19,And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.~]
[Jos,7,20,And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:~]
[Jos,8,7,Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.~]
[Jos,8,30,Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,~]
[Jos,9,9,And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,~]
[Jos,9,18,And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.~]
[Jos,9,19,But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.~]
[Jos,9,23,Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.~]
[Jos,9,24,And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.~]
[Jos,10,19,And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.~]
[Jos,10,40,So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.~]
[Jos,10,42,And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.~]
[Jos,13,14,Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he said unto them.~]
[Jos,13,33,But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them.~]
[Jos,14,6,Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea.~]
[Jos,14,8,Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.~]
[Jos,14,9,And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.~]
[Jos,14,14,Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel.~]
[Jos,18,3,And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you?~]
[Jos,18,6,Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.~]
[Jos,22,3,Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God.~]
[Jos,22,4,And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.~]
[Jos,22,5,But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.~]
[Jos,22,16,Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the LORD?~]
[Jos,22,19,Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God.~]
[Jos,22,22,The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)~]
[Jos,22,24,And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel?~]
[Jos,22,29,God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.~]
[Jos,22,33,And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.~]
[Jos,22,34,And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.~]
[Jos,23,3,And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you.~]
[Jos,23,5,And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you.~]
[Jos,23,8,But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day.~]
[Jos,23,10,One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.~]
[Jos,23,11,Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God.~]
[Jos,23,13,Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.~]
[Jos,23,14,And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof.~]
[Jos,23,15,Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.~]
[Jos,23,16,When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.~]
[Jos,24,1,And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.~]
[Jos,24,2,And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.~]
[Jos,24,16,And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;~]
[Jos,24,17,For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:~]
[Jos,24,18,And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.~]
[Jos,24,19,And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.~]
[Jos,24,23,Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.~]
[Jos,24,24,And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.~]
[Jos,24,26,And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.~]
[Jos,24,27,And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.~]
[Jdg,1,7,And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.~]
[Jdg,2,12,And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.~]
[Jdg,3,7,And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.~]
[Jdg,3,20,And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.~]
[Jdg,4,6,And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?~]
[Jdg,4,23,So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.~]
[Jdg,5,3,Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.~]
[Jdg,5,5,The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.~]
[Jdg,6,8,That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;~]
[Jdg,6,10,And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.~]
[Jdg,6,20,And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.~]
[Jdg,6,22,And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.~]
[Jdg,6,26,And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.~]
[Jdg,6,36,And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,~]
[Jdg,6,39,And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.~]
[Jdg,6,40,And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.~]
[Jdg,7,14,And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.~]
[Jdg,8,3,God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.~]
[Jdg,8,34,And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:~]
[Jdg,9,7,And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.~]
[Jdg,9,9,But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?~]
[Jdg,9,13,And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?~]
[Jdg,9,23,Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:~]
[Jdg,9,29,And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.~]
[Jdg,9,56,Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:~]
[Jdg,9,57,And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.~]
[Jdg,10,10,And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim.~]
[Jdg,11,21,And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.~]
[Jdg,11,23,So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?~]
[Jdg,11,24,Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.~]
[Jdg,13,5,For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.~]
[Jdg,13,6,Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:~]
[Jdg,13,7,But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.~]
[Jdg,13,8,Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.~]
[Jdg,13,9,And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.~]
[Jdg,13,22,And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.~]
[Jdg,15,19,But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.~]
[Jdg,16,17,That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.~]
[Jdg,16,28,And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.~]
[Jdg,18,5,And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.~]
[Jdg,18,10,When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.~]
[Jdg,18,31,And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.~]
[Jdg,20,2,And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.~]
[Jdg,20,18,And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.~]
[Jdg,20,26,Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.~]
[Jdg,20,27,And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,~]
[Jdg,20,31,And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.~]
[Jdg,21,2,And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;~]
[Jdg,21,3,And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?~]
[Rut,1,16,And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:~]
[Rut,2,12,The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.~]
[Sa1,1,17,Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.~]
[Sa1,2,2,There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.~]
[Sa1,2,3,Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.~]
[Sa1,2,27,And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?~]
[Sa1,2,30,Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.~]
[Sa1,2,32,And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.~]
[Sa1,3,3,And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;~]
[Sa1,3,17,And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.~]
[Sa1,4,4,So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.~]
[Sa1,4,7,And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.~]
[Sa1,4,8,Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.~]
[Sa1,4,11,And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.~]
[Sa1,4,13,And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.~]
[Sa1,4,17,And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.~]
[Sa1,4,18,And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.~]
[Sa1,4,19,And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.~]
[Sa1,4,21,And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.~]
[Sa1,4,22,And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.~]
[Sa1,5,1,And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod.~]
[Sa1,5,2,When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.~]
[Sa1,5,7,And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.~]
[Sa1,5,8,They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.~]
[Sa1,5,10,Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.~]
[Sa1,5,11,So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.~]
[Sa1,6,3,And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.~]
[Sa1,6,5,Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.~]
[Sa1,6,20,And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?~]
[Sa1,7,8,And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.~]
[Sa1,9,6,And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.~]
[Sa1,9,7,Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?~]
[Sa1,9,8,And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.~]
[Sa1,9,9,(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)~]
[Sa1,9,10,Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.~]
[Sa1,9,27,And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.~]
[Sa1,10,3,Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:~]
[Sa1,10,5,After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:~]
[Sa1,10,7,And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.~]
[Sa1,10,9,And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.~]
[Sa1,10,10,And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.~]
[Sa1,10,18,And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:~]
[Sa1,10,19,And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.~]
[Sa1,10,24,And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.~]
[Sa1,10,26,And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.~]
[Sa1,11,6,And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.~]
[Sa1,12,9,And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.~]
[Sa1,12,12,And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.~]
[Sa1,12,14,If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God:~]
[Sa1,12,19,And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.~]
[Sa1,12,23,Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:~]
[Sa1,13,13,And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.~]
[Sa1,14,18,And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.~]
[Sa1,14,36,And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.~]
[Sa1,14,37,And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.~]
[Sa1,14,41,Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.~]
[Sa1,14,44,And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.~]
[Sa1,14,45,And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.~]
[Sa1,15,15,And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.~]
[Sa1,15,21,But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.~]
[Sa1,15,30,Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.~]
[Sa1,16,15,And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.~]
[Sa1,16,16,Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.~]
[Sa1,16,23,And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.~]
[Sa1,17,26,And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?~]
[Sa1,17,36,Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.~]
[Sa1,17,45,Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.~]
[Sa1,17,46,This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.~]
[Sa1,18,10,And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand.~]
[Sa1,19,20,And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.~]
[Sa1,19,23,And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.~]
[Sa1,20,2,And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.~]
[Sa1,20,12,And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;~]
[Sa1,22,3,And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.~]
[Sa1,22,13,And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?~]
[Sa1,22,15,Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.~]
[Sa1,23,7,And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.~]
[Sa1,23,10,Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.~]
[Sa1,23,11,Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.~]
[Sa1,23,14,And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.~]
[Sa1,23,16,And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.~]
[Sa1,25,22,So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.~]
[Sa1,25,29,Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.~]
[Sa1,25,32,And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:~]
[Sa1,25,34,For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.~]
[Sa1,26,8,Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.~]
[Sa1,28,15,And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.~]
[Sa1,29,9,And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.~]
[Sa1,30,6,And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.~]
[Sa1,30,15,And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.~]
[Sa2,2,27,And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.~]
[Sa2,3,9,So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;~]
[Sa2,3,35,And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.~]
[Sa2,5,10,And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.~]
[Sa2,6,2,And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims.~]
[Sa2,6,3,And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.~]
[Sa2,6,4,And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.~]
[Sa2,6,6,And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.~]
[Sa2,6,7,And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.~]
[Sa2,6,12,And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.~]
[Sa2,7,2,That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.~]
[Sa2,7,22,Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.~]
[Sa2,7,23,And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?~]
[Sa2,7,24,For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.~]
[Sa2,7,25,And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said.~]
[Sa2,7,26,And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.~]
[Sa2,7,27,For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.~]
[Sa2,7,28,And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:~]
[Sa2,9,3,And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.~]
[Sa2,10,12,Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good.~]
[Sa2,12,7,And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;~]
[Sa2,12,16,David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.~]
[Sa2,14,11,Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.~]
[Sa2,14,13,And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.~]
[Sa2,14,14,For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.~]
[Sa2,14,16,For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.~]
[Sa2,14,17,Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.~]
[Sa2,14,20,To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.~]
[Sa2,15,24,And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.~]
[Sa2,15,25,And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:~]
[Sa2,15,29,Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.~]
[Sa2,15,32,And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:~]
[Sa2,16,16,And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.~]
[Sa2,16,23,And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.~]
[Sa2,18,28,And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.~]
[Sa2,18,33,And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!~]
[Sa2,19,13,And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.~]
[Sa2,19,27,And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.~]
[Sa2,21,14,And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was intreated for the land.~]
[Sa2,22,3,The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.~]
[Sa2,22,7,In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.~]
[Sa2,22,22,For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.~]
[Sa2,22,30,For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.~]
[Sa2,22,31,As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.~]
[Sa2,22,32,For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?~]
[Sa2,22,33,God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.~]
[Sa2,22,47,The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.~]
[Sa2,22,48,It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me.~]
[Sa2,23,1,Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,~]
[Sa2,23,3,The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.~]
[Sa2,23,5,Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.~]
[Sa2,24,3,And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?~]
[Sa2,24,23,All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.~]
[Sa2,24,24,And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.~]
[Kg1,1,17,And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.~]
[Kg1,1,25,For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.~]
[Kg1,1,30,Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.~]
[Kg1,1,34,And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.~]
[Kg1,1,36,And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.~]
[Kg1,1,39,And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.~]
[Kg1,1,47,And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.~]
[Kg1,1,48,And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.~]
[Kg1,2,3,And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:~]
[Kg1,2,23,Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.~]
[Kg1,2,26,And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.~]
[Kg1,3,5,In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.~]
[Kg1,3,7,And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.~]
[Kg1,3,11,And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;~]
[Kg1,3,28,And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.~]
[Kg1,4,29,And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.~]
[Kg1,5,3,Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.~]
[Kg1,5,4,But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.~]
[Kg1,5,5,And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name.~]
[Kg1,8,15,And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,~]
[Kg1,8,17,And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.~]
[Kg1,8,20,And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.~]
[Kg1,8,23,And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:~]
[Kg1,8,25,Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.~]
[Kg1,8,26,And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.~]
[Kg1,8,27,But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?~]
[Kg1,8,28,Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:~]
[Kg1,8,53,For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD God.~]
[Kg1,8,57,The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:~]
[Kg1,8,59,And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:~]
[Kg1,8,60,That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.~]
[Kg1,8,61,Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.~]
[Kg1,8,65,And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.~]
[Kg1,9,9,And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.~]
[Kg1,10,9,Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.~]
[Kg1,10,24,And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.~]
[Kg1,11,4,For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.~]
[Kg1,11,9,And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,~]
[Kg1,11,23,And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:~]
[Kg1,11,31,And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:~]
[Kg1,12,22,But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,~]
[Kg1,13,1,And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.~]
[Kg1,13,4,And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.~]
[Kg1,13,5,The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.~]
[Kg1,13,6,And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.~]
[Kg1,13,7,And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.~]
[Kg1,13,8,And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:~]
[Kg1,13,11,Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father.~]
[Kg1,13,12,And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.~]
[Kg1,13,14,And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.~]
[Kg1,13,21,And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee,~]
[Kg1,13,26,And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him.~]
[Kg1,13,29,And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.~]
[Kg1,13,31,And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:~]
[Kg1,14,7,Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,~]
[Kg1,14,13,And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.~]
[Kg1,15,3,And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.~]
[Kg1,15,4,Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:~]
[Kg1,15,30,Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.~]
[Kg1,16,13,For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.~]
[Kg1,16,26,For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.~]
[Kg1,16,33,And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.~]
[Kg1,17,1,And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.~]
[Kg1,17,12,And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.~]
[Kg1,17,14,For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.~]
[Kg1,17,18,And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?~]
[Kg1,17,20,And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?~]
[Kg1,17,21,And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.~]
[Kg1,17,24,And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.~]
[Kg1,18,10,As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.~]
[Kg1,18,21,And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.~]
[Kg1,18,24,And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.~]
[Kg1,18,36,And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.~]
[Kg1,18,37,Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.~]
[Kg1,18,39,And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.~]
[Kg1,19,8,And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.~]
[Kg1,19,10,And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.~]
[Kg1,19,14,And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.~]
[Kg1,20,28,And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.~]
[Kg1,21,10,And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.~]
[Kg1,21,13,And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.~]
[Kg1,22,53,For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.~]
[Kg2,1,3,But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?~]
[Kg2,1,6,And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.~]
[Kg2,1,9,Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.~]
[Kg2,1,10,And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.~]
[Kg2,1,11,Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.~]
[Kg2,1,12,And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.~]
[Kg2,1,13,And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.~]
[Kg2,1,16,And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.~]
[Kg2,2,14,And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.~]
[Kg2,4,7,Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.~]
[Kg2,4,9,And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.~]
[Kg2,4,16,And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.~]
[Kg2,4,21,And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.~]
[Kg2,4,22,And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.~]
[Kg2,4,25,So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:~]
[Kg2,4,27,And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.~]
[Kg2,4,40,So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.~]
[Kg2,4,42,And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.~]
[Kg2,5,3,And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.~]
[Kg2,5,7,And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.~]
[Kg2,5,8,And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.~]
[Kg2,5,11,But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.~]
[Kg2,5,14,Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.~]
[Kg2,5,15,And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.~]
[Kg2,5,20,But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.~]
[Kg2,6,6,And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.~]
[Kg2,6,9,And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.~]
[Kg2,6,10,And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.~]
[Kg2,6,15,And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?~]
[Kg2,6,31,Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.~]
[Kg2,7,2,Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?  And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.~]
[Kg2,7,17,And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.~]
[Kg2,7,18,And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:~]
[Kg2,7,19,And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.~]
[Kg2,8,2,And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.~]
[Kg2,8,4,And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.~]
[Kg2,8,7,And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.~]
[Kg2,8,8,And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?~]
[Kg2,8,11,And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.~]
[Kg2,9,6,And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.~]
[Kg2,10,31,But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.~]
[Kg2,11,12,And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.~]
[Kg2,13,19,And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.~]
[Kg2,14,25,He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gathhepher.~]
[Kg2,16,2,Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD his God, like David his father.~]
[Kg2,17,7,For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,~]
[Kg2,17,9,And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.~]
[Kg2,17,14,Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.~]
[Kg2,17,16,And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.~]
[Kg2,17,19,Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.~]
[Kg2,17,26,Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.~]
[Kg2,17,27,Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.~]
[Kg2,17,39,But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.~]
[Kg2,18,5,He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.~]
[Kg2,18,12,Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.~]
[Kg2,18,22,But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?~]
[Kg2,19,4,It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left.~]
[Kg2,19,10,Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.~]
[Kg2,19,15,And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.~]
[Kg2,19,16,LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God.~]
[Kg2,19,19,Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD God, even thou only.~]
[Kg2,19,20,Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.~]
[Kg2,20,5,Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD.~]
[Kg2,21,12,Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.~]
[Kg2,21,22,And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD.~]
[Kg2,22,15,And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,~]
[Kg2,22,18,But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, As touching the words which thou hast heard;~]
[Kg2,23,16,And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.~]
[Kg2,23,17,Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Bethel.~]
[Kg2,23,21,And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.~]
[Ch1,4,10,And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested.~]
[Ch1,5,20,And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with them: for they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them; because they put their trust in him.~]
[Ch1,5,22,For there fell down many slain, because the war was of God. And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity.~]
[Ch1,5,25,And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed before them.~]
[Ch1,5,26,And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this day.~]
[Ch1,6,48,Their brethren also the Levites were appointed unto all manner of service of the tabernacle of the house of God.~]
[Ch1,6,49,But Aaron and his sons offered upon the altar of the burnt offering, and on the altar of incense, and were appointed for all the work of the place most holy, and to make an atonement for Israel, according to all that Moses the servant of God had commanded.~]
[Ch1,9,11,And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God;~]
[Ch1,9,13,And their brethren, heads of the house of their fathers, a thousand and seven hundred and threescore; very able men for the work of the service of the house of God.~]
[Ch1,9,26,For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.~]
[Ch1,9,27,And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning pertained to them.~]
[Ch1,11,2,And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.~]
[Ch1,11,19,And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.~]
[Ch1,12,17,And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.~]
[Ch1,12,18,Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.~]
[Ch1,12,22,For at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God.~]
[Ch1,13,2,And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:~]
[Ch1,13,3,And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.~]
[Ch1,13,5,So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.~]
[Ch1,13,6,And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it.~]
[Ch1,13,7,And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.~]
[Ch1,13,8,And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.~]
[Ch1,13,10,And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.~]
[Ch1,13,12,And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?~]
[Ch1,13,14,And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.~]
[Ch1,14,10,And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? And wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.~]
[Ch1,14,11,So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim.~]
[Ch1,14,14,Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.~]
[Ch1,14,15,And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.~]
[Ch1,14,16,David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.~]
[Ch1,15,1,And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.~]
[Ch1,15,2,Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.~]
[Ch1,15,12,And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it.~]
[Ch1,15,13,For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.~]
[Ch1,15,14,So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.~]
[Ch1,15,15,And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.~]
[Ch1,15,24,And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.~]
[Ch1,15,26,And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.~]
[Ch1,16,1,So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.~]
[Ch1,16,4,And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:~]
[Ch1,16,6,Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.~]
[Ch1,16,14,He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.~]
[Ch1,16,35,And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.~]
[Ch1,16,36,Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.~]
[Ch1,16,42,And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters.~]
[Ch1,17,2,Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee.~]
[Ch1,17,3,And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,~]
[Ch1,17,16,And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?~]
[Ch1,17,17,And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.~]
[Ch1,17,20,O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.~]
[Ch1,17,21,And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?~]
[Ch1,17,22,For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.~]
[Ch1,17,24,Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee.~]
[Ch1,17,25,For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.~]
[Ch1,17,26,And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:~]
[Ch1,19,13,Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight.~]
[Ch1,21,7,And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.~]
[Ch1,21,8,And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.~]
[Ch1,21,15,And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.~]
[Ch1,21,17,And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.~]
[Ch1,21,30,But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.~]
[Ch1,22,1,Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.~]
[Ch1,22,2,And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.~]
[Ch1,22,6,Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel.~]
[Ch1,22,7,And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:~]
[Ch1,22,11,Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.~]
[Ch1,22,12,Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God.~]
[Ch1,22,18,Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.~]
[Ch1,22,19,Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.~]
[Ch1,23,14,Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.~]
[Ch1,23,25,For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:~]
[Ch1,23,28,Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;~]
[Ch1,24,5,Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.~]
[Ch1,24,19,These were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.~]
[Ch1,25,5,All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.~]
[Ch1,25,6,All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the king's order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.~]
[Ch1,26,5,Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth: for God blessed him.~]
[Ch1,26,20,And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things.~]
[Ch1,26,32,And his brethren, men of valour, were two thousand and seven hundred chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the king.~]
[Ch1,28,2,Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building:~]
[Ch1,28,3,But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood.~]
[Ch1,28,4,Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel:~]
[Ch1,28,8,Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.~]
[Ch1,28,9,And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.~]
[Ch1,28,12,And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:~]
[Ch1,28,20,And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.~]
[Ch1,28,21,And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment.~]
[Ch1,29,1,Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God.~]
[Ch1,29,2,Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.~]
[Ch1,29,3,Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house.~]
[Ch1,29,7,And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.~]
[Ch1,29,10,Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.~]
[Ch1,29,13,Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.~]
[Ch1,29,16,O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own.~]
[Ch1,29,17,I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.~]
[Ch1,29,18,O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:~]
[Ch1,29,20,And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.~]
[Ch2,1,1,And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.~]
[Ch2,1,3,So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.~]
[Ch2,1,4,But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.~]
[Ch2,1,7,In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.~]
[Ch2,1,8,And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.~]
[Ch2,1,9,Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.~]
[Ch2,1,11,And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:~]
[Ch2,2,4,Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.~]
[Ch2,2,5,And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above all gods.~]
[Ch2,2,12,Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.~]
[Ch2,3,3,Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.~]
[Ch2,4,11,And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;~]
[Ch2,4,19,And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread was set;~]
[Ch2,5,1,Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God.~]
[Ch2,5,14,So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.~]
[Ch2,6,4,And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David, saying,~]
[Ch2,6,7,Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.~]
[Ch2,6,10,The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.~]
[Ch2,6,14,And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and shewest mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts:~]
[Ch2,6,16,Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.~]
[Ch2,6,17,Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David.~]
[Ch2,6,18,But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!~]
[Ch2,6,19,Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee:~]
[Ch2,6,40,Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.~]
[Ch2,6,41,Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.~]
[Ch2,6,42,O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember the mercies of David thy servant.~]
[Ch2,7,5,And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.~]
[Ch2,7,22,And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.~]
[Ch2,8,14,And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.~]
[Ch2,9,8,Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.~]
[Ch2,9,23,And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.~]
[Ch2,10,15,So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.~]
[Ch2,11,2,But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,~]
[Ch2,11,16,And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.~]
[Ch2,13,5,Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?~]
[Ch2,13,10,But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:~]
[Ch2,13,11,And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.~]
[Ch2,13,12,And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.~]
[Ch2,13,15,Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.~]
[Ch2,13,16,And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.~]
[Ch2,13,18,Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.~]
[Ch2,14,2,And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:~]
[Ch2,14,4,And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.~]
[Ch2,14,7,Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.~]
[Ch2,14,11,And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let no man prevail against thee.~]
[Ch2,15,1,And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:~]
[Ch2,15,3,Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.~]

[Ch2,15,9,And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.~]
[Ch2,15,12,And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;~]
[Ch2,15,13,That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.~]
[Ch2,15,18,And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.~]
[Ch2,16,7,And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.~]

[Ch2,18,31,And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.~]
[Ch2,19,3,Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God.~]
[Ch2,19,4,And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.~]

[Ch2,20,12,O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.~]
[Ch2,20,15,And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.~]

[Ch2,20,20,And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.~]
[Ch2,20,29,And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel.~]
[Ch2,20,30,So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about.~]
[Ch2,20,33,Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.~]

[Ch2,24,9,And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.~]

[Ch2,25,7,But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.~]
[Ch2,25,8,But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.~]

[Ch2,25,24,And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.~]
[Ch2,26,5,And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.~]
[Ch2,26,7,And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.~]
[Ch2,26,16,But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense.~]
[Ch2,26,18,And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the LORD God.~]
[Ch2,27,6,So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God.~]
[Ch2,28,5,Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.~]
[Ch2,28,6,For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.~]
[Ch2,28,9,But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven.~]
[Ch2,28,10,And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?~]
[Ch2,28,24,And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.~]
[Ch2,28,25,And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.~]
[Ch2,29,5,And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.~]
[Ch2,29,6,For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs.~]
[Ch2,29,7,Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.~]
[Ch2,29,10,Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.~]
[Ch2,29,36,And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.~]
[Ch2,30,1,And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.~]
[Ch2,30,5,So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written.~]
[Ch2,30,6,So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.~]
[Ch2,30,7,And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.~]
[Ch2,30,8,Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.~]
[Ch2,30,9,For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.~]
[Ch2,30,12,Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.~]
[Ch2,30,16,And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.~]
[Ch2,30,19,That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.~]
[Ch2,30,22,And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.~]
[Ch2,31,6,And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.~]
[Ch2,31,13,And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.~]
[Ch2,31,14,And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.~]
[Ch2,31,20,And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.~]
[Ch2,31,21,And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.~]
[Ch2,32,8,With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.~]
[Ch2,32,11,Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?~]
[Ch2,32,14,Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?~]
[Ch2,32,15,Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?~]
[Ch2,32,16,And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah.~]
[Ch2,32,17,He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand.~]
[Ch2,32,19,And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.~]
[Ch2,32,29,Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.~]
[Ch2,32,31,Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.~]
[Ch2,33,7,And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:~]
[Ch2,33,12,And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,~]
[Ch2,33,13,And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.~]
[Ch2,33,16,And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.~]
[Ch2,33,17,Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the LORD their God only.~]
[Ch2,33,18,Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.~]
[Ch2,33,19,His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers.~]
[Ch2,34,3,For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.~]
[Ch2,34,8,Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.~]
[Ch2,34,9,And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.~]
[Ch2,34,23,And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me,~]
[Ch2,34,26,And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;~]
[Ch2,34,27,Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.~]
[Ch2,34,32,And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.~]
[Ch2,34,33,And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.~]
[Ch2,35,3,And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,~]
[Ch2,35,8,And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen.~]
[Ch2,35,21,But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.~]
[Ch2,35,22,Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.~]
[Ch2,36,5,Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.~]
[Ch2,36,12,And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the LORD.~]
[Ch2,36,13,And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.~]
[Ch2,36,15,And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:~]
[Ch2,36,16,But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was no remedy.~]
[Ch2,36,18,And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon.~]
[Ch2,36,19,And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.~]
[Ch2,36,23,Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his people?  The LORD his God be with him, and let him go up.~]
[Ezr,1,2,Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.~]
[Ezr,1,3,Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem.~]
[Ezr,1,4,And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.~]
[Ezr,1,5,Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.~]
[Ezr,2,68,And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place:~]
[Ezr,3,2,Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.~]
[Ezr,3,8,Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.~]
[Ezr,3,9,Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.~]
[Ezr,4,1,Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel;~]
[Ezr,4,2,Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.~]
[Ezr,4,3,But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.~]
[Ezr,4,24,Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.~]
[Ezr,5,1,Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them.~]
[Ezr,5,2,Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them.~]
[Ezr,5,5,But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter.~]
[Ezr,5,8,Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands.~]
[Ezr,5,11,And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up.~]
[Ezr,5,12,But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.~]
[Ezr,5,13,But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.~]
[Ezr,5,14,And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;~]
[Ezr,5,15,And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place.~]
[Ezr,5,16,Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.~]
[Ezr,5,17,Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.~]
[Ezr,6,3,In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits;~]
[Ezr,6,5,And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the house of God.~]
[Ezr,6,7,Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place.~]
[Ezr,6,8,Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered.~]
[Ezr,6,9,And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail:~]
[Ezr,6,10,That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.~]
[Ezr,6,12,And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.~]
[Ezr,6,14,And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.~]
[Ezr,6,16,And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy.~]
[Ezr,6,17,And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.~]
[Ezr,6,18,And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.~]
[Ezr,6,21,And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,~]
[Ezr,6,22,And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.~]
[Ezr,7,6,This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him.~]
[Ezr,7,9,For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.~]
[Ezr,7,12,Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time.~]
[Ezr,7,14,Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand;~]
[Ezr,7,15,And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,~]
[Ezr,7,16,And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem:~]
[Ezr,7,17,That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.~]
[Ezr,7,18,And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God.~]
[Ezr,7,19,The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.~]
[Ezr,7,20,And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house.~]
[Ezr,7,21,And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily,~]
[Ezr,7,23,Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?~]
[Ezr,7,24,Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them.~]
[Ezr,7,25,And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not.~]
[Ezr,7,26,And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.~]
[Ezr,7,27,Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem:~]
[Ezr,7,28,And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.~]
[Ezr,8,17,And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.~]
[Ezr,8,18,And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;~]
[Ezr,8,21,Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.~]
[Ezr,8,22,For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.~]
[Ezr,8,23,So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us.~]
[Ezr,8,25,And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:~]
[Ezr,8,28,And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers.~]
[Ezr,8,30,So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.~]
[Ezr,8,31,Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.~]
[Ezr,8,33,Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;~]
[Ezr,8,35,Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD.~]
[Ezr,8,36,And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God.~]
[Ezr,9,4,Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice.~]
[Ezr,9,5,And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God,~]
[Ezr,9,6,And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.~]
[Ezr,9,8,And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.~]
[Ezr,9,9,For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.~]
[Ezr,9,10,And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,~]
[Ezr,9,13,And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this;~]
[Ezr,9,15,O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.~]
[Ezr,10,1,Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.~]
[Ezr,10,2,And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.~]
[Ezr,10,3,Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.~]
[Ezr,10,6,Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.~]
[Ezr,10,9,Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.~]
[Ezr,10,11,Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives.~]
[Ezr,10,14,Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.~]
[Neh,1,4,And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,~]
[Neh,1,5,And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:~]
[Neh,2,4,Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.~]
[Neh,2,8,And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.~]
[Neh,2,12,And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.~]
[Neh,2,18,Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.~]
[Neh,2,20,Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.~]
[Neh,4,4,Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:~]
[Neh,4,9,Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.~]
[Neh,4,15,And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.~]
[Neh,4,20,In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.~]
[Neh,5,9,Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?~]
[Neh,5,13,Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.~]
[Neh,5,15,But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.~]
[Neh,5,19,Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.~]
[Neh,6,9,For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.~]
[Neh,6,10,Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.~]
[Neh,6,12,And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.~]
[Neh,6,14,My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.~]
[Neh,6,16,And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.~]
[Neh,7,2,That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.~]
[Neh,7,5,And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein,~]
[Neh,8,6,And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground.~]
[Neh,8,8,So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.~]
[Neh,8,9,And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.~]
[Neh,8,16,So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.~]
[Neh,8,18,Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.~]
[Neh,9,3,And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God.~]
[Neh,9,4,Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God.~]
[Neh,9,5,Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.~]
[Neh,9,7,Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham;~]
[Neh,9,17,And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.~]
[Neh,9,18,Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;~]
[Neh,9,31,Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.~]
[Neh,9,32,Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.~]
[Neh,10,28,And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, the singers, the Nethinims, and all they that had separated themselves from the people of the lands unto the law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every one having knowledge, and having understanding;~]
[Neh,10,29,They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord, and his judgments and his statutes;~]
[Neh,10,32,Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God;~]
[Neh,10,33,For the shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and for the continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God.~]
[Neh,10,34,And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year, to burn upon the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the law:~]
[Neh,10,36,Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests that minister in the house of our God:~]
[Neh,10,37,And that we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and of oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites, that the same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage.~]
[Neh,10,38,And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God, to the chambers, into the treasure house.~]
[Neh,10,39,For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil, unto the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers: and we will not forsake the house of our God.~]
[Neh,11,11,Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, was the ruler of the house of God.~]
[Neh,11,16,And Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chief of the Levites, had the oversight of the outward business of the house of God.~]
[Neh,11,22,The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micha. Of the sons of Asaph, the singers were over the business of the house of God.~]
[Neh,12,24,And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward.~]
[Neh,12,36,And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them.~]
[Neh,12,40,So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:~]
[Neh,12,43,Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.~]
[Neh,12,45,And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.~]
[Neh,12,46,For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.~]
[Neh,13,1,On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;~]
[Neh,13,2,Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.~]
[Neh,13,4,And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah:~]
[Neh,13,7,And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.~]
[Neh,13,9,Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.~]
[Neh,13,11,Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.~]
[Neh,13,14,Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.~]
[Neh,13,18,Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.~]
[Neh,13,22,And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.~]
[Neh,13,25,And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.~]
[Neh,13,26,Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.~]
[Neh,13,27,Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?~]
[Neh,13,29,Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.~]
[Neh,13,31,And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.~]
[Job,1,1,There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.~]
[Job,1,5,And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.~]
[Job,1,6,Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.~]
[Job,1,8,And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?~]
[Job,1,9,Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?~]
[Job,1,16,While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.~]
[Job,1,22,In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.~]
[Job,2,1,Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.~]
[Job,2,3,And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.~]
[Job,2,9,Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity?  curse God, and die.~]
[Job,2,10,But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.~]
[Job,3,4,Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.~]
[Job,3,23,Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?~]
[Job,4,9,By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.~]
[Job,4,17,Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?~]
[Job,5,8,I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:~]
[Job,5,17,Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:~]
[Job,6,4,For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.~]
[Job,6,8,Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!~]
[Job,6,9,Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!~]
[Job,8,3,Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?~]
[Job,8,5,If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;~]
[Job,8,13,So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:~]
[Job,8,20,Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:~]
[Job,9,2,I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?~]
[Job,9,13,If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.~]
[Job,10,2,I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.~]
[Job,11,5,But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;~]
[Job,11,6,And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.~]
[Job,11,7,Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?~]
[Job,12,4,I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.~]
[Job,12,6,The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.~]
[Job,13,3,Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.~]
[Job,13,7,Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?~]
[Job,13,8,Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?~]
[Job,15,4,Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.~]
[Job,15,8,Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?~]
[Job,15,11,Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?~]
[Job,15,13,That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?~]
[Job,15,25,For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.~]
[Job,16,11,God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.~]
[Job,16,20,My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.~]
[Job,16,21,O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!~]
[Job,18,21,Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.~]
[Job,19,6,Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.~]
[Job,19,21,Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.~]
[Job,19,22,Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?~]
[Job,19,26,And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:~]
[Job,20,15,He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.~]
[Job,20,23,When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.~]
[Job,20,29,This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.~]
[Job,21,9,Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.~]
[Job,21,14,Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.~]
[Job,21,17,How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.~]
[Job,21,19,God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.~]
[Job,21,22,Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.~]
[Job,22,2,Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?~]
[Job,22,12,Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!~]
[Job,22,13,And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?~]
[Job,22,17,Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?~]
[Job,22,26,For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.~]
[Job,23,16,For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:~]
[Job,24,12,Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.~]
[Job,25,4,How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?~]
[Job,27,2,As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;~]
[Job,27,3,All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;~]
[Job,27,5,God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.~]
[Job,27,8,For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?~]
[Job,27,9,Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?~]
[Job,27,10,Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?~]
[Job,27,11,I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.~]
[Job,27,13,This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.~]
[Job,27,22,For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.~]
[Job,28,23,God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.~]
[Job,29,2,Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;~]
[Job,29,4,As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;~]
[Job,31,2,For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?~]
[Job,31,6,Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity.~]
[Job,31,14,What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?~]
[Job,31,23,For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.~]
[Job,31,28,This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.~]
[Job,32,2,Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.~]
[Job,32,13,Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.~]

[Job,33,26,He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.~]
[Job,33,29,Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,~]
[Job,34,5,For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.~]
[Job,34,9,For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.~]
[Job,34,10,Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.~]
[Job,34,12,Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.~]
[Job,34,23,For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.~]
[Job,34,31,Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:~]
[Job,34,37,For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.~]
[Job,35,2,Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?~]
[Job,35,10,But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;~]
[Job,35,13,Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.~]
[Job,36,2,Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.~]
[Job,36,5,Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.~]
[Job,36,22,Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?~]
[Job,36,26,Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.~]
[Job,37,5,God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.~]
[Job,37,10,By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.~]
[Job,37,14,Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.~]
[Job,37,15,Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?~]
[Job,37,22,Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.~]
[Job,38,7,When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?~]
[Job,38,41,Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.~]
[Job,39,17,Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.~]
