[Psa,68,15,The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan.~]
[Psa,68,16,Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.~]
[Psa,68,17,The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.~]
[Psa,68,18,Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.~]
[Psa,68,19,Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation. Selah.~]
[Psa,68,20,He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord belong the issues from death.~]
[Psa,68,21,But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.~]
[Psa,68,24,They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.~]
[Psa,68,26,Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.~]
[Psa,68,28,Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.~]
[Psa,68,31,Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.~]
[Psa,68,32,Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah:~]
[Psa,68,34,Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds.~]
[Psa,68,35,O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.~]
[Psa,69,1,Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.~]
[Psa,69,3,I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.~]
[Psa,69,5,O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.~]
[Psa,69,6,Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.~]
[Psa,69,13,But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.~]
[Psa,69,29,But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.~]
[Psa,69,30,I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.~]
[Psa,69,32,The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.~]
[Psa,69,35,For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.~]
[Psa,70,4,Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.~]
[Psa,70,5,But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.~]
[Psa,71,4,Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.~]
[Psa,71,11,Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him.~]
[Psa,71,12,O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.~]
[Psa,71,17,O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.~]
[Psa,71,18,Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.~]
[Psa,71,19,Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great things: O God, who is like unto thee!~]
[Psa,71,22,I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.~]
[Psa,72,1,Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son.~]
[Psa,72,18,Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.~]
[Psa,73,1,Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.~]
[Psa,73,11,And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?~]
[Psa,73,17,Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.~]
[Psa,73,26,My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.~]
[Psa,73,28,But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.~]
[Psa,74,1,O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?~]
[Psa,74,8,They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.~]
[Psa,74,10,O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?~]
[Psa,74,12,For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.~]
[Psa,74,22,Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.~]
[Psa,75,1,Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.~]
[Psa,75,7,But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.~]
[Psa,75,9,But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.~]
[Psa,76,1,In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.~]
[Psa,76,6,At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.~]
[Psa,76,9,When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.~]
[Psa,76,11,Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.~]
[Psa,77,1,I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.~]
[Psa,77,3,I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.~]
[Psa,77,9,Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.~]
[Psa,77,13,Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?~]
[Psa,77,14,Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.~]
[Psa,77,16,The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.~]
[Psa,78,7,That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:~]
[Psa,78,8,And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.~]
[Psa,78,10,They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;~]
[Psa,78,18,And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.~]
[Psa,78,19,Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?~]
[Psa,78,22,Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:~]
[Psa,78,31,The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.~]
[Psa,78,34,When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.~]
[Psa,78,35,And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.~]
[Psa,78,41,Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.~]
[Psa,78,56,Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:~]
[Psa,78,59,When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:~]
[Psa,79,1,O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.~]
[Psa,79,9,Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.~]
[Psa,79,10,Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed.~]
[Psa,80,3,Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.~]
[Psa,80,4,O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?~]
[Psa,80,7,Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.~]
[Psa,80,14,Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;~]
[Psa,80,19,Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.~]
[Psa,81,1,Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.~]
[Psa,81,4,For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.~]
[Psa,81,10,I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.~]
[Psa,82,1,God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.~]
[Psa,82,8,Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.~]
[Psa,83,1,Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.~]
[Psa,83,12,Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.~]
[Psa,83,13,O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.~]
[Psa,84,2,My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.~]
[Psa,84,3,Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.~]
[Psa,84,7,They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.~]
[Psa,84,8,O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.~]
[Psa,84,9,Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.~]
[Psa,84,10,For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.~]
[Psa,84,11,For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.~]
[Psa,85,4,Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.~]
[Psa,85,8,I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.~]
[Psa,86,2,Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.~]
[Psa,86,10,For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.~]
[Psa,86,12,I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.~]
[Psa,86,14,O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.~]
[Psa,86,15,But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, long suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.~]
[Psa,87,3,Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.~]
[Psa,88,1,O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:~]
[Psa,89,7,God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.~]
[Psa,89,8,O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?~]
[Psa,89,26,He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.~]
[Psa,90,2,Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.~]
[Psa,90,17,And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.~]
[Psa,91,2,I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.~]
[Psa,92,13,Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.~]
[Psa,94,1,O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.~]
[Psa,94,7,Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.~]
[Psa,94,22,But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.~]
[Psa,94,23,And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off.~]
[Psa,95,3,For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.~]
[Psa,95,7,For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,~]
[Psa,98,3,He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.~]
[Psa,99,5,Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.~]
[Psa,99,8,Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.~]
[Psa,99,9,Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.~]
[Psa,100,3,Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.~]
[Psa,102,24,I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.~]
[Psa,104,1,Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.~]
[Psa,104,21,The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.~]
[Psa,104,33,I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.~]
[Psa,105,7,He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.~]
[Psa,106,14,But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.~]
[Psa,106,21,They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;~]
[Psa,106,47,Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.~]
[Psa,106,48,Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.~]
[Psa,107,11,Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:~]
[Psa,108,5,Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;~]
[Psa,108,7,God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.~]
[Psa,108,11,Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?~]
[Psa,108,13,Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.~]
[Psa,109,1,Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;~]
[Psa,109,26,Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:~]
[Psa,113,5,Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,~]
[Psa,114,7,Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;~]
[Psa,115,2,Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?~]
[Psa,115,3,But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.~]
[Psa,116,5,Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.~]
[Psa,118,27,God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.~]
[Psa,118,28,Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.~]
[Psa,119,115,Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.~]
[Psa,122,9,Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.~]
[Psa,123,2,Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.~]
[Psa,132,2,How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;~]
[Psa,132,5,Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.~]
[Psa,135,2,Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God.~]
[Psa,136,2,O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for ever.~]
[Psa,136,26,O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever.~]
[Psa,139,17,How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!~]
[Psa,139,19,Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.~]
[Psa,139,23,Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:~]
[Psa,140,6,I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.~]
[Psa,143,10,Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.~]
[Psa,144,9,I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.~]
[Psa,144,15,Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.~]
[Psa,145,1,I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.~]
[Psa,146,2,While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.~]
[Psa,146,5,Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God:~]
[Psa,146,10,The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD.~]
[Psa,147,1,Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.~]
[Psa,147,7,Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God:~]
[Psa,147,12,Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.~]
[Psa,149,6,Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand;~]
[Psa,150,1,Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power.~]
[Pro,2,5,Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.~]
[Pro,2,17,Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.~]
[Pro,3,4,So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.~]
[Pro,21,12,The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.~]
[Pro,25,2,It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.~]
[Pro,26,10,The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.~]
[Pro,30,5,Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.~]
[Pro,30,9,Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.~]
[Ecc,1,13,And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.~]
[Ecc,2,24,There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.~]
[Ecc,2,26,For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.~]
[Ecc,3,10,I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.~]
[Ecc,3,11,He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.~]
[Ecc,3,13,And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.~]
[Ecc,3,14,I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.~]
[Ecc,3,15,That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.~]
[Ecc,3,17,I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.~]
[Ecc,3,18,I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.~]
[Ecc,5,1,Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.~]
[Ecc,5,2,Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.~]
[Ecc,5,4,When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.~]
[Ecc,5,6,Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?~]
[Ecc,5,7,For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear thou God.~]
[Ecc,5,18,Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his portion.~]
[Ecc,5,19,Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.~]
[Ecc,5,20,For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.~]
[Ecc,6,2,A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.~]
[Ecc,7,13,Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?~]
[Ecc,7,14,In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.~]
[Ecc,7,18,It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.~]
[Ecc,7,26,And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.~]
[Ecc,7,29,Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.~]
[Ecc,8,2,I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God.~]
[Ecc,8,12,Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:~]
[Ecc,8,13,But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.~]
[Ecc,8,15,Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.~]
[Ecc,8,17,Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.~]
[Ecc,9,1,For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them.~]
[Ecc,9,7,Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.~]
[Ecc,11,5,As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.~]
[Ecc,11,9,Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.~]
[Ecc,12,7,Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.~]
[Ecc,12,13,Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.~]
[Ecc,12,14,For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.~]
[Isa,1,10,Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.~]
[Isa,2,3,And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.~]
[Isa,5,16,But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.~]
[Isa,7,11,Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.~]
[Isa,7,13,And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?~]

[Jer,37,7,Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.~]
[Jer,38,17,Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:~]
[Jer,39,16,Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee.~]
[Jer,40,2,And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.~]
[Jer,42,2,And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:)~]
[Jer,42,3,That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do.~]
[Jer,42,4,Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.~]
[Jer,42,5,Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us.~]
[Jer,42,6,Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.~]
[Jer,42,9,And said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him;~]
[Jer,42,13,But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God,~]
[Jer,42,15,And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;~]
[Jer,42,18,For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.~]
[Jer,42,20,For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it.~]
[Jer,42,21,And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you.~]
[Jer,43,1,And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words,~]
[Jer,43,2,Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there:~]
[Jer,43,10,And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.~]
[Jer,44,2,Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,~]
[Jer,44,7,Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;~]
[Jer,44,11,Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.~]
[Jer,44,25,Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.~]
[Jer,45,2,Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch:~]

[Jer,50,4,In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.~]
[Jer,50,18,Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.~]
[Jer,50,28,The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.~]
[Jer,50,40,As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.~]
[Jer,51,5,For Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.~]
[Jer,51,10,The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.~]
[Jer,51,33,For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.~]
[Jer,51,56,Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite.~]
[Lam,3,41,Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.~]
[Eze,1,1,Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.~]
[Eze,8,3,And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.~]
[Eze,8,4,And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.~]
[Eze,9,3,And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side;~]
[Eze,10,5,And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.~]
[Eze,10,19,And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside them, and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.~]
[Eze,10,20,This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims.~]
[Eze,11,20,That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.~]
[Eze,11,22,Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.~]
[Eze,11,24,Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.~]

[Eze,20,7,Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.~]
[Eze,20,19,I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;~]
[Eze,20,20,And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God.~]
[Eze,28,2,Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God:~]
[Eze,28,6,Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God;~]
[Eze,28,9,Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee.~]
[Eze,28,13,Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.~]
[Eze,28,14,Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.~]
[Eze,28,16,By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.~]
[Eze,28,26,And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I am the LORD their God.~]
[Eze,31,8,The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.~]
[Eze,31,9,I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.~]
[Eze,34,24,And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken it.~]

[Eze,37,23,Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.~]
[Eze,37,27,My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.~]
[Eze,39,22,So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from that day and forward.~]
[Eze,39,28,Then shall they know that I am the LORD their God, which caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them any more there.~]

[Eze,44,2,Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.~]
[Dan,1,2,And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.~]
[Dan,1,9,Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.~]
[Dan,1,17,As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.~]
[Dan,2,18,That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.~]
[Dan,2,19,Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.~]
[Dan,2,20,Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:~]
[Dan,2,23,I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter.~]
[Dan,2,28,But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;~]
[Dan,2,37,Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.~]
[Dan,2,44,And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.~]
[Dan,2,45,Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.~]
[Dan,2,47,The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.~]
[Dan,3,15,Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?~]
[Dan,3,17,If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.~]
[Dan,3,25,He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.~]
[Dan,3,26,Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.~]
[Dan,3,28,Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.~]
[Dan,3,29,Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.~]
[Dan,4,2,I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me.~]
[Dan,4,8,But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying,~]
[Dan,5,3,Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.~]
[Dan,5,18,O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:~]
[Dan,5,21,And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.~]
[Dan,5,23,But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:~]
[Dan,5,26,This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.~]
[Dan,6,5,Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.~]
[Dan,6,7,All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.~]
[Dan,6,10,Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.~]
[Dan,6,11,Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.~]
[Dan,6,12,Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.~]
[Dan,6,16,Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.~]
[Dan,6,20,And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?~]
[Dan,6,22,My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.~]
[Dan,6,23,Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.~]
[Dan,6,26,I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.~]
[Dan,9,3,And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:~]
[Dan,9,4,And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;~]
[Dan,9,9,To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;~]
[Dan,9,10,Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.~]
[Dan,9,11,Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.~]
[Dan,9,13,As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.~]
[Dan,9,14,Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice.~]
[Dan,9,15,And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.~]
[Dan,9,17,Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.~]
[Dan,9,18,O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.~]
[Dan,9,19,O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.~]
[Dan,9,20,And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;~]
[Dan,10,12,Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.~]
[Dan,11,32,And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.~]
[Dan,11,36,And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.~]
[Dan,11,37,Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.~]
[Dan,11,38,But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.~]
[Hos,1,6,And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.~]
[Hos,1,7,But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.~]
[Hos,1,9,Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.~]
[Hos,1,10,Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God.~]
[Hos,2,23,And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.~]
[Hos,3,5,Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.~]
[Hos,4,1,Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.~]
[Hos,4,6,My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.~]
[Hos,4,12,My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.~]
[Hos,5,4,They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.~]
[Hos,6,6,For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.~]
[Hos,7,10,And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.~]
[Hos,8,2,Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.~]
[Hos,8,6,For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.~]
[Hos,9,1,Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor.~]
[Hos,9,8,The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God.~]
[Hos,9,17,My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.~]
[Hos,11,9,I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.~]
[Hos,11,12,Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.~]
[Hos,12,3,He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:~]
[Hos,12,5,Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD is his memorial.~]
[Hos,12,6,Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment and wait on thy God continually.~]
[Hos,12,9,And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.~]
[Hos,13,4,Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for there is no saviour beside me.~]
[Hos,13,16,Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.~]
[Hos,14,1,O israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.~]
[Joe,1,13,Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.~]
[Joe,1,14,Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD,~]
[Joe,1,16,Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God?~]
[Joe,2,13,And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.~]
[Joe,2,14,Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God?~]
[Joe,2,17,Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?~]
[Joe,2,23,Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.~]

[Amo,4,12,Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.~]
[Amo,4,13,For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.~]
[Amo,5,14,Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.~]
[Amo,5,15,Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.~]
[Amo,5,16,Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, saith thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas!  and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.~]
[Amo,5,27,Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.~]
[Amo,6,8,The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.~]
[Amo,6,14,But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness.~]
[Amo,9,15,And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD thy God.~]

[Jon,3,5,So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.~]
[Jon,3,8,But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.~]
[Jon,3,9,Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?~]
[Jon,3,10,And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not.~]
[Jon,4,2,And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.~]
[Jon,4,6,And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.~]
[Jon,4,7,But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.~]

[Mic,4,2,And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.~]
[Mic,4,5,For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.~]
[Mic,5,4,And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.~]
[Mic,6,6,Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?~]
[Mic,6,8,He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?~]

[Mat,15,3,But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?~]
[Mat,15,4,For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.~]

[Mat,26,61,And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.~]
[Mat,26,63,But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.~]
[Mat,27,40,And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.~]
[Mat,27,43,He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.~]

[Mar,3,35,For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.~]
[Mar,4,11,And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:~]
[Mar,4,26,And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;~]
[Mar,4,30,And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?~]
[Mar,5,7,And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.~]
[Mar,7,8,For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.~]

[Mar,9,47,And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:~]
[Mar,10,6,But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.~]
[Mar,10,9,What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.~]
[Mar,10,14,But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.~]
[Mar,10,15,Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.~]
[Mar,10,18,And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.~]

[Mar,12,14,And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?~]
[Mar,12,17,And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.~]
[Mar,12,24,And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?~]
[Mar,12,26,And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?~]
[Mar,12,27,He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.~]

[Mar,12,34,And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.~]
[Mar,13,19,For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.~]
[Mar,14,25,Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.~]

[Act,17,30,And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:~]

[Act,20,21,Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.~]
[Act,20,24,But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.~]
[Act,20,25,And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.~]

[Act,23,1,And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.~]
[Act,23,3,Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?~]
[Act,23,4,And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?~]
[Act,23,9,And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.~]
[Act,24,14,But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:~]
[Act,24,15,And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.~]
[Act,24,16,And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offence toward God, and toward men.~]
[Act,26,6,And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God, unto our fathers:~]
[Act,26,7,Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.~]
[Act,26,8,Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?~]
[Act,26,18,To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.~]

[Act,26,22,Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:~]
[Act,26,29,And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.~]
[Act,27,23,For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,~]
[Act,27,24,Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.~]
[Act,27,25,Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.~]
[Act,27,35,And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.~]

[Rom,1,1,Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,~]

[Rom,1,7,To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.~]
[Rom,1,8,First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.~]
[Rom,1,9,For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;~]
[Rom,1,10,Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.~]
[Rom,1,16,For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.~]
[Rom,1,17,For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.~]
[Rom,1,18,For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;~]
[Rom,1,19,Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.~]
[Rom,1,20,For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:~]
[Rom,1,21,Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.~]
[Rom,1,23,And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.~]
[Rom,1,24,Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:~]
[Rom,1,25,Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.~]
[Rom,1,26,For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:~]
[Rom,1,28,And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;~]
[Rom,1,30,Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,~]
[Rom,1,32,Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.~]
[Rom,2,2,But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.~]
[Rom,2,3,And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?~]
[Rom,2,4,Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?~]
[Rom,2,5,But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;~]
[Rom,2,11,For there is no respect of persons with God.~]
[Rom,2,13,(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.~]
[Rom,2,16,In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.~]
[Rom,2,17,Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,~]
[Rom,2,23,Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?~]
[Rom,2,24,For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.~]
[Rom,2,29,But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.~]
[Rom,3,2,Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.~]
[Rom,3,3,For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?~]
[Rom,3,4,God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.~]
[Rom,3,5,But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)~]
[Rom,3,6,God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?~]
[Rom,3,7,For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?~]
[Rom,3,11,There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.~]
[Rom,3,18,There is no fear of God before their eyes.~]
[Rom,3,19,Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.~]
[Rom,3,21,But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;~]
[Rom,3,22,Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:~]
[Rom,3,23,For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;~]
[Rom,3,25,Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;~]
[Rom,3,29,Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:~]
[Rom,3,30,Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.~]
[Rom,3,31,Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.~]
[Rom,4,2,For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.~]
[Rom,4,3,For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.~]
[Rom,4,6,Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,~]
[Rom,4,17,(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.~]
[Rom,4,20,He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;~]
[Rom,5,1,Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:~]
[Rom,5,2,By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.~]
[Rom,5,5,And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.~]
[Rom,5,8,But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.~]
[Rom,5,10,For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.~]
[Rom,5,11,And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.~]
[Rom,5,15,But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.~]
[Rom,6,2,God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?~]
[Rom,6,10,For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.~]
[Rom,6,11,Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.~]
[Rom,6,13,Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.~]
[Rom,6,15,What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.~]
[Rom,6,17,But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.~]
[Rom,6,22,But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.~]
[Rom,6,23,For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.~]
[Rom,7,4,Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.~]
[Rom,7,7,What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.~]
[Rom,7,13,Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.~]
[Rom,7,22,For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:~]
[Rom,7,25,I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.~]
[Rom,8,3,For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:~]
[Rom,8,7,Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.~]
[Rom,8,8,So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.~]
[Rom,8,9,But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.~]
[Rom,8,14,For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.~]
[Rom,8,16,The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:~]
[Rom,8,17,And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.~]
[Rom,8,19,For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.~]
[Rom,8,21,Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.~]
[Rom,8,27,And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.~]
[Rom,8,28,And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.~]
[Rom,8,31,What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?~]
[Rom,8,33,Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.~]
[Rom,8,34,Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.~]
[Rom,8,39,Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.~]
[Rom,9,4,Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;~]
[Rom,9,5,Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.~]
[Rom,9,6,Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:~]
[Rom,9,8,That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.~]
[Rom,9,11,(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)~]
[Rom,9,14,What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.~]
[Rom,9,16,So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.~]
[Rom,9,20,Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?~]
[Rom,9,22,What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:~]
[Rom,9,26,And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.~]
[Rom,10,1,Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.~]
[Rom,10,2,For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.~]
[Rom,10,3,For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.~]
[Rom,10,9,That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.~]
[Rom,10,17,So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.~]
[Rom,11,1,I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.~]
[Rom,11,2,God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying,~]
[Rom,11,4,But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.~]
[Rom,11,8,(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.~]
[Rom,11,11,I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.~]
[Rom,11,21,For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.~]
[Rom,11,22,Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.~]
[Rom,11,23,And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.~]
[Rom,11,29,For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.~]
[Rom,11,30,For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:~]
[Rom,11,32,For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.~]
[Rom,11,33,O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!  how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!~]
[Rom,12,1,I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.~]
[Rom,12,2,And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.~]
[Rom,12,3,For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.~]
[Rom,13,1,Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.~]
[Rom,13,2,Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.~]
[Rom,13,4,For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.~]
[Rom,13,6,For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.~]
[Rom,14,3,Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.~]
[Rom,14,4,Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.~]
[Rom,14,6,He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.~]
[Rom,14,11,For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.~]
[Rom,14,12,So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.~]
[Rom,14,17,For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.~]
[Rom,14,18,For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.~]
[Rom,14,20,For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.~]
[Rom,14,22,Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.~]
[Rom,15,5,Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:~]
[Rom,15,6,That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.~]
[Rom,15,7,Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.~]
[Rom,15,8,Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:~]
[Rom,15,9,And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.~]
[Rom,15,13,Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.~]
[Rom,15,15,Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,~]
[Rom,15,16,That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.~]
[Rom,15,17,I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.~]
[Rom,15,19,Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.~]
[Rom,15,30,Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;~]
[Rom,15,32,That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.~]
[Rom,15,33,Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.~]
[Rom,16,20,And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.~]
[Rom,16,26,But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:~]
[Rom,16,27,To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.~]
[Co1,1,1,Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,~]
[Co1,1,2,Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their's and our's:~]
[Co1,1,3,Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.~]
[Co1,1,4,I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;~]
[Co1,1,9,God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.~]
[Co1,1,14,I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;~]
[Co1,1,18,For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.~]
[Co1,1,20,Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?~]
[Co1,1,21,For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.~]
[Co1,1,24,But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.~]
[Co1,1,25,Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.~]
[Co1,1,27,But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;~]
[Co1,1,28,And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:~]
[Co1,1,30,But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:~]
[Co1,2,1,And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.~]
[Co1,2,5,That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.~]
[Co1,2,7,But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:~]
[Co1,2,9,But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.~]
[Co1,2,10,But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.~]
[Co1,2,11,For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.~]
[Co1,2,12,Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.~]
[Co1,2,14,But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.~]
[Co1,3,6,I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.~]
[Co1,3,7,So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.~]
[Co1,3,9,For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.~]
[Co1,3,10,According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.~]
[Co1,3,16,Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?~]
[Co1,3,17,If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.~]
[Co1,3,19,For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.~]
[Co1,3,23,And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.~]
[Co1,4,1,Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.~]
[Co1,4,5,Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.~]
[Co1,4,8,Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.~]
[Co1,4,9,For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.~]
[Co1,4,20,For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.~]
[Co1,5,13,But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.~]
[Co1,6,9,Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?  Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,~]
[Co1,6,10,Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.~]
[Co1,6,11,And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.~]
[Co1,6,13,Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.~]
[Co1,6,14,And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.~]
[Co1,6,15,Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.~]
[Co1,6,19,What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?~]
[Co1,6,20,For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.~]
[Co1,7,7,For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.~]
[Co1,7,15,But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.~]
[Co1,7,17,But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.~]
[Co1,7,19,Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.~]
[Co1,7,24,Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.~]
[Co1,7,40,But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.~]
[Co1,8,3,But if any man love God, the same is known of him.~]
[Co1,8,4,As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.~]
[Co1,8,6,But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.~]
[Co1,8,8,But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.~]
[Co1,9,9,For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?~]
[Co1,9,21,To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.~]
[Co1,10,5,But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.~]
[Co1,10,13,There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.~]
[Co1,10,20,But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.~]
[Co1,10,31,Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.~]
[Co1,10,32,Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:~]
[Co1,11,3,But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.~]
[Co1,11,7,For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.~]
[Co1,11,12,For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.~]
[Co1,11,13,Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?~]
[Co1,11,16,But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.~]
[Co1,11,22,What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.~]
[Co1,12,3,Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.~]
[Co1,12,6,And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.~]
[Co1,12,18,But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.~]
[Co1,12,24,For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked.~]
[Co1,12,28,And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.~]
[Co1,14,2,For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.~]
[Co1,14,18,I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:~]
[Co1,14,25,And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.~]
[Co1,14,28,But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.~]
[Co1,14,33,For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.~]
[Co1,14,36,What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?~]
[Co1,15,9,For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.~]
[Co1,15,10,But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.~]
[Co1,15,15,Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.~]
[Co1,15,24,Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.~]
[Co1,15,28,And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.~]
[Co1,15,34,Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.~]
[Co1,15,38,But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.~]
[Co1,15,50,Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.~]
[Co1,15,57,But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.~]
[Co1,16,2,Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.~]
[Co2,1,1,Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:~]
[Co2,1,2,Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.~]
[Co2,1,3,Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;~]
[Co2,1,4,Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.~]
[Co2,1,9,But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:~]
[Co2,1,12,For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.~]
[Co2,1,18,But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.~]
[Co2,1,19,For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.~]
[Co2,1,20,For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.~]
[Co2,1,21,Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;~]
[Co2,1,23,Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.~]
[Co2,2,14,Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.~]
[Co2,2,15,For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:~]
[Co2,2,17,For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.~]
[Co2,3,3,Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.~]
[Co2,3,4,And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:~]
[Co2,3,5,Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;~]
[Co2,4,2,But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.~]
[Co2,4,4,In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.~]
[Co2,4,6,For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.~]
[Co2,4,7,But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.~]
[Co2,4,15,For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.~]
[Co2,5,1,For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.~]
[Co2,5,5,Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.~]
[Co2,5,11,Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.~]
[Co2,5,13,For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.~]
[Co2,5,18,And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;~]
[Co2,5,19,To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.~]
[Co2,5,20,Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.~]
[Co2,5,21,For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.~]
[Co2,6,1,We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.~]
[Co2,6,4,But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,~]
[Co2,6,7,By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,~]
[Co2,6,16,And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.~]
[Co2,7,1,Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.~]
[Co2,7,6,Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;~]
[Co2,7,12,Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.~]
[Co2,8,1,Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;~]
[Co2,8,5,And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.~]
[Co2,8,16,But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.~]
[Co2,9,7,Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.~]
[Co2,9,8,And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:~]
[Co2,9,11,Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.~]
[Co2,9,12,For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;~]
[Co2,9,13,Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;~]
[Co2,9,14,And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.~]
[Co2,9,15,Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.~]
[Co2,10,4,(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)~]
[Co2,10,5,Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;~]
[Co2,10,13,But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.~]
[Co2,11,1,Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.~]
[Co2,11,7,Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?~]
[Co2,11,11,Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.~]
[Co2,11,31,The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.~]
[Co2,12,2,I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.~]
[Co2,12,3,And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)~]
[Co2,12,19,Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.~]
[Co2,12,21,And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.~]
[Co2,13,4,For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.~]
[Co2,13,7,Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.~]
[Co2,13,11,Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.~]
[Co2,13,14,The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.~]
[Gal,1,1,Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)~]
[Gal,1,3,Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,~]
[Gal,1,4,Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:~]
[Gal,1,10,For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.~]
[Gal,1,13,For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:~]
[Gal,1,15,But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,~]
[Gal,1,20,Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.~]
[Gal,1,24,And they glorified God in me.~]
[Gal,2,6,But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:~]
[Gal,2,17,But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.~]
[Gal,2,19,For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.~]
[Gal,2,20,I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.~]
[Gal,2,21,I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.~]
[Gal,3,6,Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.~]
[Gal,3,8,And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.~]
[Gal,3,11,But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.~]
[Gal,3,17,And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.~]
[Gal,3,18,For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.~]
[Gal,3,20,Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.~]
[Gal,3,21,Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.~]
[Gal,3,26,For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.~]
[Gal,4,4,But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,~]
[Gal,4,6,And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.~]
[Gal,4,7,Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.~]
[Gal,4,8,Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.~]
[Gal,4,9,But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?~]
[Gal,4,14,And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.~]
[Gal,5,21,Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.~]
[Gal,6,7,Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.~]
[Gal,6,14,But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.~]
[Gal,6,16,And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.~]
[Eph,1,1,Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:~]
[Eph,1,2,Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.~]
[Eph,1,3,Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:~]
[Eph,1,17,That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:~]
[Eph,2,4,But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,~]
[Eph,2,8,For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:~]
[Eph,2,10,For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.~]
[Eph,2,12,That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:~]
[Eph,2,16,And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:~]
[Eph,2,19,Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;~]
[Eph,2,22,In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.~]
[Eph,3,2,If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:~]
[Eph,3,7,Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.~]
[Eph,3,9,And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:~]
[Eph,3,10,To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,~]
[Eph,3,19,And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.~]
[Eph,4,6,One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.~]
[Eph,4,13,Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:~]
[Eph,4,18,Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:~]
[Eph,4,24,And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.~]
[Eph,4,30,And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.~]
[Eph,4,32,And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.~]
[Eph,5,1,Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;~]
[Eph,5,2,And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.~]
[Eph,5,5,For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.~]
[Eph,5,6,Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.~]
[Eph,5,20,Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;~]
[Eph,5,21,Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.~]
[Eph,6,6,Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;~]
[Eph,6,11,Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.~]
[Eph,6,13,Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.~]
[Eph,6,17,And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:~]
[Eph,6,23,Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.~]
[Phi,1,2,Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.~]
[Phi,1,3,I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,~]
[Phi,1,8,For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.~]
[Phi,1,11,Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.~]
[Phi,1,28,And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.~]
[Phi,2,6,Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:~]
[Phi,2,9,Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:~]
[Phi,2,11,And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.~]
[Phi,2,13,For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.~]
[Phi,2,15,That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;~]
[Phi,2,27,For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.~]
[Phi,3,3,For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.~]
[Phi,3,9,And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:~]
[Phi,3,14,I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.~]
[Phi,3,15,Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.~]
[Phi,3,19,Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)~]
[Phi,4,6,Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.~]
[Phi,4,7,And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.~]
[Phi,4,9,Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.~]
[Phi,4,18,But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.~]
[Phi,4,19,But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.~]
[Phi,4,20,Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.~]
[Col,1,1,Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,~]
[Col,1,2,To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.~]
[Col,1,3,We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,~]
[Col,1,6,Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:~]
[Col,1,10,That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;~]
[Col,1,15,Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:~]
[Col,1,25,Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;~]
[Col,1,27,To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:~]
[Col,2,2,That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;~]
[Col,2,9,For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.~]
[Col,2,12,Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.~]
[Col,2,19,And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.~]
[Col,3,1,If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.~]
[Col,3,3,For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.~]
[Col,3,6,For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:~]
[Col,3,12,Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;~]
[Col,3,15,And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.~]
[Col,3,17,And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.~]
[Col,3,22,Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;~]
[Col,4,3,Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:~]
[Col,4,11,And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.~]
[Col,4,12,Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.~]
[Th1,1,1,Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.~]

[Th1,1,3,Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;~]
[Th1,1,4,Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.~]
[Th1,1,8,For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.~]
[Th1,1,9,For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;~]
[Th1,2,2,But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.~]
[Th1,2,4,But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.~]
[Th1,2,5,For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:~]
[Th1,2,8,So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.~]
[Th1,2,9,For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.~]
[Th1,2,10,Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:~]
[Th1,2,12,That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.~]
[Th1,2,13,For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.~]
[Th1,2,14,For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:~]
[Th1,2,15,Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:~]
[Th1,3,2,And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:~]
[Th1,3,9,For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;~]
[Th1,3,11,Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.~]
[Th1,3,13,To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.~]
[Th1,4,1,Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.~]
[Th1,4,3,For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:~]
[Th1,4,5,Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:~]
[Th1,4,7,For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.~]
[Th1,4,8,He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.~]
[Th1,4,9,But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.~]
[Th1,4,14,For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.~]
[Th1,4,16,For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:~]
[Th1,5,9,For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,~]
[Th1,5,18,In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.~]
[Th1,5,23,And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.~]
[Th2,1,1,Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:~]

[Th2,1,3,We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;~]
[Th2,1,4,So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:~]
[Th2,1,5,Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:~]
[Th2,1,6,Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;~]
[Th2,1,8,In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:~]
[Th2,1,11,Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:~]
[Th2,1,12,That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.~]
[Th2,2,4,Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.~]
[Th2,2,11,And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:~]
[Th2,2,13,But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:~]
[Th2,2,16,Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,~]
[Th2,3,5,And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.~]
[Ti1,1,1,Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;~]
[Ti1,1,2,Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.~]
[Ti1,1,11,According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.~]
[Ti1,1,17,Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.~]
[Ti1,2,3,For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;~]
[Ti1,2,5,For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;~]
[Ti1,3,5,(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)~]
[Ti1,3,15,But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.~]
[Ti1,3,16,And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.~]
[Ti1,4,3,Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.~]
[Ti1,4,4,For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:~]
[Ti1,4,5,For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.~]
[Ti1,4,10,For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.~]
[Ti1,5,4,But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.~]
[Ti1,5,5,Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.~]
[Ti1,5,21,I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.~]
[Ti1,6,1,Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.~]
[Ti1,6,11,But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.~]
[Ti1,6,13,I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;~]
[Ti1,6,17,Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;~]
[Ti2,1,1,Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,~]
[Ti2,1,2,To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.~]
[Ti2,1,3,I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;~]
[Ti2,1,6,Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.~]
[Ti2,1,7,For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.~]
[Ti2,1,8,Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;~]
[Ti2,2,9,Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.~]
[Ti2,2,15,Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.~]
[Ti2,2,19,Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.~]
[Ti2,2,25,In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;~]
[Ti2,3,4,Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;~]
[Ti2,3,16,All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:~]
[Ti2,3,17,That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.~]
[Ti2,4,1,I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;~]
[Ti2,4,16,At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.~]
[Tit,1,1,Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;~]
[Tit,1,2,In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;~]
[Tit,1,3,But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;~]
[Tit,1,4,To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.~]
[Tit,1,7,For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;~]
[Tit,1,16,They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.~]
[Tit,2,5,To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.~]
[Tit,2,10,Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.~]
[Tit,2,11,For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,~]
[Tit,2,13,Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;~]
[Tit,3,4,But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,~]
[Tit,3,8,This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.~]
[Plm,1,3,Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.~]
[Plm,1,4,I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,~]
[Heb,1,1,God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,~]
[Heb,1,6,And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.~]
[Heb,1,8,But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.~]
[Heb,1,9,Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.~]
[Heb,2,4,God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?~]
[Heb,2,9,But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.~]
[Heb,2,13,And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.~]
[Heb,2,17,Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.~]
[Heb,3,4,For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.~]
[Heb,3,12,Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.~]
[Heb,4,4,For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.~]
[Heb,4,9,There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.~]
[Heb,4,10,For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.~]
[Heb,4,12,For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.~]
[Heb,4,14,Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.~]
[Heb,5,1,For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:~]
[Heb,5,4,And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.~]
[Heb,5,10,Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.~]
[Heb,5,12,For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.~]
[Heb,6,1,Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,~]
[Heb,6,3,And this will we do, if God permit.~]
[Heb,6,5,And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,~]
[Heb,6,6,If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.~]
[Heb,6,7,For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:~]
[Heb,6,10,For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.~]
[Heb,6,13,For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,~]
[Heb,6,17,Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:~]
[Heb,6,18,That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:~]
[Heb,7,1,For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;~]
[Heb,7,3,Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.~]
[Heb,7,19,For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.~]
[Heb,7,25,Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.~]
[Heb,8,5,Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.~]
[Heb,8,10,For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:~]
[Heb,9,6,Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.~]
[Heb,9,14,How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?~]
[Heb,9,20,Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.~]
[Heb,9,24,For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:~]
[Heb,10,7,Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.~]
[Heb,10,9,Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.~]
[Heb,10,12,But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;~]
[Heb,10,21,And having an high priest over the house of God;~]
[Heb,10,29,Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?~]
[Heb,10,31,It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.~]
[Heb,10,36,For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.~]
[Heb,11,3,Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.~]
[Heb,11,4,By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.~]
[Heb,11,5,By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.~]
[Heb,11,6,But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.~]
[Heb,11,7,By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.~]
[Heb,11,10,For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.~]
[Heb,11,16,But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.~]
[Heb,11,19,Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.~]
[Heb,11,25,Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;~]
[Heb,11,40,God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.~]
[Heb,12,2,Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.~]
[Heb,12,7,If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?~]
[Heb,12,15,Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;~]
[Heb,12,22,But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,~]
[Heb,12,23,To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,~]
[Heb,12,28,Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:~]
[Heb,12,29,For our God is a consuming fire.~]
[Heb,13,4,Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.~]
[Heb,13,7,Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.~]
[Heb,13,15,By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.~]
[Heb,13,16,But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.~]
[Heb,13,20,Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,~]
[Jam,1,1,James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.~]
[Jam,1,5,If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.~]
[Jam,1,13,Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:~]
[Jam,1,20,For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.~]
[Jam,1,27,Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.~]
[Jam,2,5,Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?~]
[Jam,2,19,Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.~]
[Jam,2,23,And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.~]
[Jam,3,9,Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.~]
[Jam,4,4,Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.~]
[Jam,4,6,But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.~]
[Jam,4,7,Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.~]
[Jam,4,8,Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.~]
[Pe1,1,2,Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.~]
[Pe1,1,3,Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,~]
[Pe1,1,5,Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.~]
[Pe1,1,21,Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.~]
[Pe1,1,23,Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.~]
[Pe1,2,4,To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,~]
[Pe1,2,5,Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.~]
[Pe1,2,10,Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.~]
[Pe1,2,12,Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.~]
[Pe1,2,15,For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:~]
[Pe1,2,16,As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.~]
[Pe1,2,17,Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.~]
[Pe1,2,19,For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.~]
[Pe1,2,20,For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.~]
[Pe1,3,4,But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.~]
[Pe1,3,5,For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:~]
[Pe1,3,15,But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:~]
[Pe1,3,17,For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.~]
[Pe1,3,18,For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:~]
[Pe1,3,20,Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.~]
[Pe1,3,21,The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:~]
[Pe1,3,22,Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.~]
[Pe1,4,2,That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.~]
[Pe1,4,6,For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.~]
[Pe1,4,10,As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.~]
[Pe1,4,11,If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.~]
[Pe1,4,14,If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.~]
[Pe1,4,16,Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.~]
[Pe1,4,17,For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?~]
[Pe1,4,19,Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.~]
[Pe1,5,2,Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;~]
[Pe1,5,3,Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.~]
[Pe1,5,5,Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.~]
[Pe1,5,6,Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:~]
[Pe1,5,10,But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.~]
[Pe1,5,12,By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.~]
[Pe2,1,1,Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:~]
[Pe2,1,2,Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,~]
[Pe2,1,17,For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.~]
[Pe2,1,21,For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.~]
[Pe2,2,4,For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;~]
[Pe2,3,5,For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:~]
[Pe2,3,12,Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?~]
[Jo1,1,5,This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.~]
[Jo1,2,5,But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.~]
[Jo1,2,14,I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.~]
[Jo1,2,17,And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.~]
[Jo1,3,1,Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.~]
[Jo1,3,2,Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.~]
[Jo1,3,8,He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.~]
[Jo1,3,9,Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.~]
[Jo1,3,10,In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.~]
[Jo1,3,16,Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.~]
[Jo1,3,17,But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?~]
[Jo1,3,20,For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.~]
[Jo1,3,21,Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.~]
[Jo1,4,1,Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.~]
[Jo1,4,2,Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:~]
[Jo1,4,3,And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.~]
[Jo1,4,4,Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.~]
[Jo1,4,6,We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.~]
[Jo1,4,7,Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.~]
[Jo1,4,8,He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.~]
[Jo1,4,9,In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.~]
[Jo1,4,10,Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.~]
[Jo1,4,11,Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.~]
[Jo1,4,12,No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.~]
[Jo1,4,15,Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.~]
[Jo1,4,16,And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.~]
[Jo1,4,20,If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?~]
[Jo1,4,21,And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.~]
[Jo1,5,1,Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.~]
[Jo1,5,2,By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.~]
[Jo1,5,3,For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.~]
[Jo1,5,4,For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.~]
[Jo1,5,5,Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?~]
[Jo1,5,9,If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.~]
[Jo1,5,10,He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.~]
[Jo1,5,11,And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.~]
[Jo1,5,12,He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.~]
[Jo1,5,13,These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.~]
[Jo1,5,18,We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.~]
[Jo1,5,19,And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.~]
[Jo1,5,20,And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.~]
[Jo2,1,3,Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.~]
[Jo2,1,9,Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.~]
[Jo2,1,10,If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:~]
[Jo2,1,11,For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.~]
[Jo3,1,11,Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.~]
[Jde,1,1,Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:~]
[Jde,1,4,For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.~]
[Jde,1,21,Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.~]
[Jde,1,25,To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.~]
[Rev,1,1,The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:~]
[Rev,1,2,Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.~]
[Rev,1,6,And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.~]
[Rev,1,9,I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.~]
[Rev,2,7,He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.~]
[Rev,2,18,And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;~]
[Rev,3,1,And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.~]
